Gitlab also provides additional features such as issue tracking, continuous integration, and code review tools.")

print("Question 2: What is the difference between GitLab, GitHub, and Bitbucket?")

The main differences between them are the features they offer and the pricing models they use. GitLab is open-source and offers a self-hosted option, GitHub is more focused on social coding and collaboration, and Bitbucket is more focused on integration with other Atlassian products.")

print("Question 3: Why would I ever want to use git, but not Gitlab?")
print("Answer: Git is a version control system that allows you to track changes in your code, while Gitlab is a web-based Git repository manager that provides a graphical interface for managing your Git repositories. You may want to use Git without Gitlab if you prefer to manage your repositories locally or if you are working on a project that does not require the additional features provided by Gitlab.")
